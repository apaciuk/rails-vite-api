# rails-vite-api

A Look at and implementation of the recently released Devise API Gem Ruby/Rails API only backend user authentiation with a sample Vanilla JS frontend (not quite so simple!)
It provides support for access bearer tokens and refresh tokens, which allow you to authenticate API requests and keep the user's session active for a longer period of time than usual on the client side.

Can be implemented in a Rails backend in a few steps with the devise and devise-api gems, a cors.rb initializer, a small user model and small pages controller with restricted and standard actions. Adjust routes for use with api/v1 etc endpoints.

Woot!
